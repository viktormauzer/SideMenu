# SideMenu

UIKit based side menu activated by button press for a Swift iOS app. To showcase the feature, I made an "email-like" app where users can open the menu by pressing the navigation bar button. The menu slides from the left and shows possible categories to filter shown messages. To close the menu, users can either tap on a category or tap at the empty spaces to the right.

Custom views and table view cells made using xib files.
